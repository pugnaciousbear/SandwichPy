# SandwichPy
A Python implementation of the main features that Sandwich Delivery has. Oh...Did I mention its open source???

legit a 2000+ line discord bot rewritten in a tenth of that....crazy

# Why?

This is mainly a project for me to familiarize myself with Python. Obviously not the best choice but I already like python so /shrug.

Will see what comes of it
